Overview - 
This ML model is trained to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It uses the XGBoostClassifier algorithm, optimized with Hyperopt, on a dataset containing over 74,000 records. The project demonstrates key AI concepts like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Features - 
Predicts whether an employee will leave or stay in a company.
Utilizes RobustScaler for scaling and 83-17 train-test split for better model generalization.
Employs advanced hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Includes feature encoding and detailed exploratory data analysis.

Technologies Used - 
Python
Jupyter Notebook
XGBoost
Hyperopt
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset - 
The dataset contains 74,498 records and 24 features, sourced from Kaggle, covering demographic, job-related, and personal data.

Results - 
The XGBoost model achieved high accuracy and interpretability. The hyperparameters optimized with Hyperopt yielded consistent improvements in performance metrics.
